# dotfiles

## Current status
By now this version is for *nix enviroments. The primary target is a remote-container in VS Code.
A variant for using some/most of the features with git-bash-for-windows is thinkable but not yet ready.  
Main problems:
- bash-it is way to slow when used full featured due to the Shell-Wrapper-Stuff. (it takes very long to get the prompt back when in git repository files - even if the most slowing down features are already turned off)
- dotbot requires python. This is considered a too-big-requirement
